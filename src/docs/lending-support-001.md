## Overview
The Lending Support Service offers banks, loan issuers/providers a data intelligence platform that mitigates the risk factor involved in granting facility to loan applicants. Remita consists of a salary payment platform
hosting a considerable amount of its customer&#39;s salary information. SystemSpecs shares this data with the loan issuer to enable them determine applicants&#39; eligibility in terms of loan amounts they can realistically repay from their net salaries. The integration will also facilitate repayment of the loans by deducting the loan amounts from applicants&#39; salary accounts when wages are paid.

*  Request Salary Payment History : This involves the issuer sending a request to Remita for the applicants&#39; salary payment history. The execution of this method implies that the loan issuers&#39; customers have opted into the service (consent has been obtained).

* Loan Disbursement Notification : The issuer/bank then informs SystemSpecs of loan amounts already granted to the applicant/customer. This notification automatically creates a Direct Debit mandate for the customer

* Stop Loan Collection : This is used to request a STOP on the collection of a repayment amount due.

* Mandate Payment History: This is used to request a payment history on a mandate that has been set up via the loan disbursement endpoint.
