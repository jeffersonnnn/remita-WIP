## Overview - Biller API

Thank you for your interest in implementing Remita Biller API

The Remita Biller API enables your customers make payments to billers on Remita through your platform. This provides you with the capability to offer your customers access to the vast array of billers and merchants, including schools, churches, service providers and the Federal Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) available on Remita to purchase and subscribe to their various products and services.

Below are the links to the postman collection documentation and the SDKs for your review and implementation.
